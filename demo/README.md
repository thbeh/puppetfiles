## Consul Integration Demo

This is the example stack for a 2 part blog post I wrote:

- [Provisioning Consul with Puppet](http://txt.fliglio.com/2014/10/consul-with-puppet/)
- [Consul, Spring Boot, Actuator, and Codahale Metrics](http://txt.fliglio.com/2014/10/spring-boot-actuator/)



So head there and see how i'm using it to show things off, or just run it on its own:


### Build

	./gradlew build


### Run
	
	java -jar build/libs/demo-0.1.0.jar
